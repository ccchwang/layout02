# transition01

A microsite experimenting with unique page transitions and animations. By [Chloe Hwang](https://chloehwang.github.io).

Inspired by this [design concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/3059607-Mossio-Concept) from [Mossio](https://mossio.co/) and [Kovastudio](http://kovastudio.com/). See the final product [H E R E](https://chloehwang.github.io/transition01/).
