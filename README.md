# transition01

A microsite experimenting with unique page transitions and floating header animations. Hand-coded by [Cho Hwang](https://chohwang.com).

Inspired by this [design concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/3059607-Mossio-Concept) from [Mossio](https://mossio.co/) and [Kovastudio](http://kovastudio.com/).

See the final product [HERE](https://ccchwang.github.io/transition01/).
